<MITRE ATT&CK framework> is a attacker playbook ‚Äî how they get in your system. how they move. what they do. what their end goals are and how it impacts your system. 

MITRE ATT&CK currently lists 12 common tactics for the Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix with a total of 226 known adversarial techniques.

+ Initial Access 
+ Execution
+ Persistence
+ Privilege Escalation
+ Defense Evasion 
+ Credential Access 
+ Discovery 
+ Lateral Movement ‚Äî techniques used to enter and control remote systems on a network from the already compromised host.
+ Collection
+ Command & Control 
+ Exfiltration 
+ Impact



<Cyber Kill Chain>: its designed for defenders to improve their defenses by analyzing an attacker playbook and interrupting the attack by breaking the kill chain at each phase.

Reconnaissance ‚Äî Attackers gather information about their target. 

Weaponization ‚Äî Attackers now create an attack that exploits vulnerabilities found in reconnaissance. many leverage tools from metasploit, exploit-db, or a social engineering toolkit.

Delivery ‚Äî Once an attacker has chosen which tools are best suited to exploit your vulnerabilities, they will select their delivery method, be it phishing emails, infected USBs, or another method of choice.

Exploitation ‚Äî The weapon has been delivered. The attacker just needs to execute the attack, which could take the form of a SQL injection, a buffer overflow, RCE, as well as countless others.

Installation ‚Äî The attacker gains better access. Common adversarial techniques include executing powershell in fileless attacks, installing remote access tools (RAT), and DLL hijacking.

Command & Control (C2) ‚Äî The attacker now sets up persistent access to your system for remote manipulation. 

Actions on Objectives ‚Äî The attacker achieves their intrusion objective, e.g., data exfiltration, data destruction, or denial of service.

+ Insecure Design
+ Security Misconfiguration 
+ Vulnerable and Outdated Components
+ Identification and Authentication Failures
+ Software and Data Integrity Failures 
+ Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Metasploit:


+ exploits: (aix  bsdi firefox irix   multi   solaris	  android    dialup  freebsd  linux  netware  unix  apple_ios  hpux  mainframe  osx  windows)
				
+ auxiliary - include port scanners.. fuzzers.. sniffers and more. (admin   client   dos  gather  scanner  spoof  vsploit analyze  crawler  example.rb  parser  server  sqli  bnat  docx   fuzzers   pdf  sniffer  voip)
	
+ payloads - consists of code that runs remotely..				
		(singles  stagers  stages)
	
+ encoders - encoders ensure that payloads make it to their destination intact. (cmd  generic  mipsbe  mipsle  php  ppc  ruby  sparc  x64  x86)
				
+ nops - nops keep the payload sizes consistent across exploit attempts..
